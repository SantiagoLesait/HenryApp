```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```
- Install [Mongoodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) on your computer and create a database called HenryApp.

- Head to the [Googledeveloper](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector2/apis/dashboard?supportedpurview=project&pli=1) consoles to obtain your OAuth keys. If you're unfamiliat with the process, you can find some helpful guides [here](https://developers.google.com/fit/android/get-api-key).

- Sign up with [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) and obtain an API key.

- Create a .env file in in the api folder with the following contents:

```
DATABASE_ATLAS=mongodb+srv://HenryApp:HenryAppAtlas@cluster0.bucqc.mongodb.net/test

passportSecret={Anything you want}

googleClientID={Your Google OAuth ID}

The app doesn't have any products or users created by default, you'll have to add them yourself! In order to do so, you'll have to log in as an admin. The default admin is:

Email: admin@henry.com

```
